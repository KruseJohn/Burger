# Eat-Da-Burger

A Burger Eatin' Application With Node.js/Express/MySQL/Handlebars/Bootstrap

![label](https://github.com/KruseJohn/Burger/blob/master/public/assets/img/burger2.png)


## Description

This application demonstrates a simple full stack application with the front end implemented with HTML/CSS and elements from the Bootstrap framework. The backend is implemented with Node.js and Express. HTML templating is done with the help of Handlebars.

The user may enter any burger name to add it to the menu. This also adds the new burger entry into the MySQL database. The initial burger entry is added as *ready to eat* on the menu and placed on the left side of the screen. The user may then eat any burger by clicking on the burger button, which moves it into the adjacent column and updates its status accordingly in the database.  The user may also choose to delete a burger once devoured, with the database reflecting this change as well...
